Description

Extended versions of the rock â€“ paper - scissors game. Before the start of the game, the user is able to choose the options that will be used. After entering his/her name, the user should provide a list of options separated by a comma. For example: 

    rock,paper,scissors,lizard,spock

Whatever list of options the user chooses, the program is able to identify the relationships between different options. First, every option is equal to itself (causing a draw if both the user and the computer choose the same option). Secondly, every option wins over one half of the other options of the list and gets defeated by another half (spock and rock will be beating the lizard, and paper and scissors will get defeated by it).

Example:

    Enter your name: > Tim
    Hello, Tim
    > rock,gun,lightning,devil,dragon,water,air,paper,sponge,wolf,tree,human,snake,scissors,fire
    Okay, let's start
    > rock
    Sorry, but the computer chose air
